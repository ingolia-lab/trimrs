Read structure
* Raw name
* Raw sequence
* Optionally, Raw quality
* 5' and 3' trim boundaries
* 5' and 3' N-mask boundaries
* UMI positions for read name modification
* Tags for read name modification
* Read destination
    * Single output
    * Discard
    * Too-short
    * No-adapter
    * Named demultiplexing
    * Nucleotide demultiplexing (up to 4 bases)

Read 1 and optional read 2

Must harmonize destinations between read 1 and read 2 after processing

Use cases:

1. Simple RNA-Seq, etc.
    * Pure command line specification of adapter sequence, etc.
    * Input and/or output may be piped
    * Input and/or output may be compressed
